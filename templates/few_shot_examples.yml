      What is the complexity of the following code snippet?:
      ```python
      for i, j in zip(range(10), range(7)):
      print(i, j)
      ```
    model: The complexity if this code is O(1), meaning that it runs in a constant time independently of the input.

      Thanks! What is the complexity of the code below:
      ```python
      for i in range(10):
        for j in range(7):
          print(i, j)
      ```
    model: The complexity if this code is O(1), because there is a fixed amount of operations in the loop.

      What is the complexity of the following piece of code?
      ```python
      N = 100
      tot = 0
      for i in range(N):
          tot += i
      ```
    model: Once again, the code complexity of this code is O(1). The time is constant.

      What about this snippet?
      ```python
      N = 100
      for i in range(N):
          for j in range(N):
              for k in range(N):
                  a = i*j*k
      ```
    model: As always, the code runs in constant time. That is, the complexity is O(1).
